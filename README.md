# Foursquare Movement SDK for Flutter

A third-party Flutter plugin for the Foursquare Movement SDK, enabling passive location detection, geofencing, and venue matching in your Flutter apps.

## Features
- Passive location detection
- Venue matching and place detection
- Geofence monitoring
- Debug tools for testing

## Installation
Add to `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  foursquare_movement_sdk: ^0.0.1
```
Or use a git dependency.

## Platform Setup
The Movement SDK must be configured in native code before your Flutter app starts.

### iOS
- Add location keys to `Info.plist` (Always/WhenInUse) and `UIBackgroundModes` with `location`.
- Configure in `AppDelegate.swift`:
```swift
import MovementSdk
MovementSdkManager.shared.configure(
  withConsumerKey: "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY",
  secret: "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET",
  oauthToken: nil,
  delegate: nil,
  completion: nil
)
```

### Android
- Add location permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml` including background location if needed.
- Configure in `Application`:
```kotlin
MovementSdk.with(
  MovementSdk.Builder(this).consumer("YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY", "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET").enableDebugLogs()
)
```

## Usage
```dart
import 'package:foursquare_movement_sdk/foursquare_movement_sdk.dart';

await MovementSdk.start();
final current = await MovementSdk.getCurrentLocation();
print(current.currentPlace.venue?.name);
```

### Real-time Events
Listen for visit and geofence events via broadcast streams:
```dart
MovementSdk.onVisit.listen((visit) {
  print('Visited: ${visit.venue?.name}');
});

MovementSdk.onGeofenceEvents.listen((events) {
  for (final event in events) {
    print('Geofence ${event.eventType}: ${event.name}');
  }
});
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run unit tests for the plugin's Dart API and data models:
```bash
flutter test
```

These tests verify that the Pigeon-generated API surface and data models are correctly constructed.

### Example App Tests
The example app includes widget tests and integration tests:

```bash
cd example
flutter test                                    # Widget tests
flutter test integration_test                   # Integration tests
```

**Important**: Integration tests require:
- Valid Foursquare Movement SDK consumer key and secret configured in the native code
- Location permissions granted on the device/emulator
- The SDK to be properly initialized

Without proper SDK configuration, integration tests will fail with authentication or SDK initialization errors.

### Building the Example
To build the example app for Android:
```bash
cd example
flutter build apk --debug
```

For iOS (requires macOS with Xcode):
```bash
cd example
flutter build ios --no-codesign
```

### Static Analysis
Run static analysis to verify code quality:
```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Requirements
- **Foursquare Credentials**: Obtain consumer key and secret from the [Foursquare Developer Console](https://foursquare.com/developers/)
- **iOS**: iOS 13.0+, Xcode 14+
- **Android**: minSdk 24 (Android 7.0), compileSdk 36
- **Location Permissions**: Both platforms require appropriate location permission declarations and runtime permission grants
